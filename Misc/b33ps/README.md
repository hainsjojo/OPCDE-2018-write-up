**Write up**

We have been given a `flac` file, after a lot of analysis of the file including analysing the spectogram.. we could't find anything interesting.

After a bit of googling we found this tool called `minimodem` 
> Minimodem is a command-line program which decodes (or generates) audio
> modem tones at any specified baud rate, using various framing protocols.
> It acts a general-purpose software FSK modem, and includes support for
> various standard FSK protocols such as Bell103, Bell202, RTTY, TTY/TDD,
> NOAA SAME, and Caller-ID.
